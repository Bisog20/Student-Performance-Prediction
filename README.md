# 🎓 Predicting Student Academic Performance using Regression Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the final grade (G3) of students using regression analysis on the [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance).  
Here, I employed the linear regression model to build a model to predict the fianl grade (G3) based on features such as study time, internet access, absences and so on. 

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Target Variable:** G3 (Final Grade)
- **Features:** Study time, absences, internet access, family background, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Results
- Best Model: **Linear Regressor**
- MAE: 1.38
- R² Score: 0.77
